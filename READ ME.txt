This project uses gulp.js for better development workflow.

You will probably have to install a few missing node modules by running the command "npm install" in the cmd to install the missing packages.

Other useful git commands:
"gulp" - launches a browser with live code injecting while making changes to the code in the "src" folder
"gulp build" - automatically generates the production ready "dist" folder with minified versions of .css and .js


The styles were written using sass. The files are:
_mixin.scss - contains some useful mixins that I generated over the years for faster development
_settings.scss - contains general websites settings, colors, fonts and some other things
mobile.scss - contains the responsive styles
styles.scss - this is the main stylesheet


I have prepared the full responsive version from desktop to mobile, I hope that is ok. 

You can access the mobile menu by clicking on the hamburger icon in the header, and the profile dropdown by clicking on the profile in the header.

I am also using a jQuery script lib/img-resize.js,
which is used on <img> tags and automatically scaled the img and centers it both vertically and horizontally in its container. In my opinion
it is a super useful tool to have to display images, which may have not been cropped before uploading to the CMS, otherwise this is of course
not needed.

If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask, I would be happy to explain.
